This dataset comes from an American bank that offers car insurance in addition to its standard services. This bank has potential customersâ€™ data, and bank employees call them for advertising available car insurance options.




* This dataset contains general customer data (age, employment, etc.), as well as more detailed information on the current insurance sales campaign (communication, last contact day), as well as data from earlier campaigns (attributes like previous attempts, outcome).

* This dataset has two subsets,one to train the model(training set) and another subset to test the trained model.

* The task is to predict for 1000 customers (test set) who were contacted during the current campaign, whether they will buy car insurance or not.
